# Qplay Bubbles - Alpha
Qplay Bubbles (also known as [Bubble Blaster](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38897822/trouble-with-bubble-blaster-python-code)), the advanced way.  

## Download and running from source
> Note: You need Anaconda to run it. Because the standard Python have issues with Pillow.  
> For Unix users: you need a desktop to run the game, CLI is incompatible.  
> For Mac users: It's possible that the game is not working on 64-bit mode.  
> For Windows users: There is probably no problem with running it. (only errors I make by myself)  

Method 1: (Using an IDE)
1.  Download Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)
2.  Download an IDE. _I use [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)_
3.  Download the source code of the repository in zip format.
4.  Install Anaconda, and follow the installation instructions. Be sure to add it to path.
5.  Install the IDE, you want to use.
6.  Unpack the downloaded source code. To your home folder.
    (For UNIX based: /home/<username>, For Windows: C:\Users\<username>, For macOS: \Users\<username>)
7.  Open the unpacked folder.
8.  Open the folder inside the folder of **step 7**. (When there is only one folder inside)
9.  On Windows: Right click on _\_\_main\_\_.py_ and click on open with, click on "search for another app on your pc" or something similar. 
    And search for the anaconda installation. 
    Then in the _anaconda folder_ select _python.exe_ to use with cmd or _python**w**.exe_ for without cmd.  
10. On UNIX based: Open terminal or bash,  
    and type `python3.7 __main__.py` or `python3 __main__.py` in the terminal or bash.

Method 2: (Using Executable) **NOTE: ONLY WINDOWS**
1. Download the executable from [here](https://github.com/Qboi123/Qplay-Bubbles-Alpha/releases).
2. Open the file.

## Old repositories and sources
I found [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38897822/trouble-with-bubble-blaster-python-code) page when i was searching, to solve a problem. The code was of a book I got.
